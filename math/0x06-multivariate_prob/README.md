# 0. Mean and Covariance
Write a function def mean_cov(X): that calculates the mean and covariance of a data set:

- X is a numpy.ndarray of shape (n, d) containing the data set:
    - n is the number of data points
    - d is the number of dimensions in each data point
    - If X is not a 2D numpy.ndarray, raise a TypeError with the message X must be a 2D numpy.ndarray
    - If n is less than 2, raise a ValueError with the message X must contain multiple data points
- Returns: mean, cov:
    - mean is a numpy.ndarray of shape (1, d) containing the mean of the data set
    - cov is a numpy.ndarray of shape (d, d) containing the covariance matrix of the data set
- You are not allowed to use the function numpy.cov

# 1. Correlation
Write a function def correlation(C): that calculates a correlation matrix:

- C is a numpy.ndarray of shape (d, d) containing a covariance matrix
    - d is the number of dimensions
    - If C is not a numpy.ndarray, raise a TypeError with the message C must be a numpy.ndarray
    - If C does not have shape (d, d), raise a ValueError with the message C must be a 2D square matrix
- Returns a numpy.ndarray of shape (d, d) containing the correlation matrix

# 2. Initialize
Create the class MultiNormal that represents a Multivariate Normal distribution:

- class constructor def __init__(self, data):
    - data is a numpy.ndarray of shape (d, n) containing the data set:
    - n is the number of data points
    - d is the number of dimensions in each data point
    - If data is not a 2D numpy.ndarray, raise a TypeError with the message data must be a 2D numpy.ndarray
    - If n is less than 2, raise a ValueError with the message data must contain multiple data points
- Set the public instance variables:
    - mean - a numpy.ndarray of shape (d, 1) containing the mean of data
    - cov - a numpy.ndarray of shape (d, d) containing the covariance matrix data
- You are not allowed to use the function numpy.cov
