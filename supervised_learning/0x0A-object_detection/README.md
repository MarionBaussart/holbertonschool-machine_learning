# 0x0A-object_detection

## 0. Initialize Yolo
Write a class Yolo that uses the Yolo v3 algorithm to perform object detection:

- class constructor: def __init__(self, model_path, classes_path, class_t, nms_t, anchors):
    - model_path is the path to where a Darknet Keras model is stored
    - classes_path is the path to where the list of class names used for the Darknet model, listed in order of index, can be found
    - class_t is a float representing the box score threshold for the initial filtering step
    - nms_t is a float representing the IOU threshold for non-max suppression
    - anchors is a numpy.ndarray of shape (outputs, anchor_boxes, 2) containing all of the anchor boxes:
        - outputs is the number of outputs (predictions) made by the Darknet model
        - anchor_boxes is the number of anchor boxes used for each prediction
        - 2 => [anchor_box_width, anchor_box_height]
- Public instance attributes:
    - model: the Darknet Keras model
    - class_names: a list of the class names for the model
    - class_t: the box score threshold for the initial filtering step
    - nms_t: the IOU threshold for non-max suppression
    - anchors: the anchor boxes

## 1. Process Outputs
Write a class Yolo (Based on 0-yolo.py):

- Add the public method def process_outputs(self, outputs, image_size):
    - outputs is a list of numpy.ndarrays containing the predictions from the Darknet model for a single image:
        - Each output will have the shape (grid_height, grid_width, anchor_boxes, 4 + 1 + classes)
            - grid_height & grid_width => the height and width of the grid used for the output
            - anchor_boxes => the number of anchor boxes used
            - 4 => (t_x, t_y, t_w, t_h)
            - 1 => box_confidence
            - classes => class probabilities for all classes
    - image_size is a numpy.ndarray containing the image’s original size [image_height, image_width]
    - Returns a tuple of (boxes, box_confidences, box_class_probs):
        - boxes: a list of numpy.ndarrays of shape (grid_height, grid_width, anchor_boxes, 4) containing the processed boundary boxes for each output, respectively:
            - 4 => (x1, y1, x2, y2)
            - (x1, y1, x2, y2) should represent the boundary box relative to original image
        - box_confidences: a list of numpy.ndarrays of shape (grid_height, grid_width, anchor_boxes, 1) containing the box confidences for each output, respectively
        - box_class_probs: a list of numpy.ndarrays of shape (grid_height, grid_width, anchor_boxes, classes) containing the box’s class probabilities for each output, respectively

HINT: The Darknet model is an input to the class for a reason. It may not always have the same number of outputs, input sizes, etc.

## 2. Filter Boxes
Write a class Yolo (Based on 1-yolo.py):

- Add the public method def filter_boxes(self, boxes, box_confidences, box_class_probs):
    - boxes: a list of numpy.ndarrays of shape (grid_height, grid_width, anchor_boxes, 4) containing the processed boundary boxes for each output, respectively
    - box_confidences: a list of numpy.ndarrays of shape (grid_height, grid_width, anchor_boxes, 1) containing the processed box confidences for each output, respectively
    - box_class_probs: a list of numpy.ndarrays of shape (grid_height, grid_width, anchor_boxes, classes) containing the processed box class probabilities for each output, respectively
    - Returns a tuple of (filtered_boxes, box_classes, box_scores):
        - filtered_boxes: a numpy.ndarray of shape (?, 4) containing all of the filtered bounding boxes:
        - box_classes: a numpy.ndarray of shape (?,) containing the class number that each box in filtered_boxes predicts, respectively
        - box_scores: a numpy.ndarray of shape (?) containing the box scores for each box in filtered_boxes, respectively

## 3. Non-max Suppression
Write a class Yolo (Based on 2-yolo.py):

- Add the public method def non_max_suppression(self, filtered_boxes, box_classes, box_scores):
    - filtered_boxes: a numpy.ndarray of shape (?, 4) containing all of the filtered bounding boxes:
    - box_classes: a numpy.ndarray of shape (?,) containing the class number for the class that filtered_boxes predicts, respectively
    - box_scores: a numpy.ndarray of shape (?) containing the box scores for each box in filtered_boxes, respectively
    - Returns a tuple of (box_predictions, predicted_box_classes, predicted_box_scores):
        - box_predictions: a numpy.ndarray of shape (?, 4) containing all of the predicted bounding boxes ordered by class and box score
        - predicted_box_classes: a numpy.ndarray of shape (?,) containing the class number for box_predictions ordered by class and box score, respectively
        - predicted_box_scores: a numpy.ndarray of shape (?) containing the box scores for box_predictions ordered by class and box score, respectively
