## 0. Placeholders
Write the function def create_placeholders(nx, classes): that returns two placeholders, x and y, for the neural network:

- nx: the number of feature columns in our data
- classes: the number of classes in our classifier
- Returns: placeholders named x and y, respectively
    - x is the placeholder for the input data to the neural network
    - y is the placeholder for the one-hot labels for the input data

## 1. Layers
Write the function def create_layer(prev, n, activation):

- prev is the tensor output of the previous layer
- n is the number of nodes in the layer to create
- activation is the activation function that the layer should use
- use tf.keras.initializers.VarianceScaling(mode='fan_avg') to implement He et. al initialization for the layer weights
- each layer should be given the name layer
- Returns: the tensor output of the layer

## 2. Forward Propagation
Write the function def forward_prop(x, layer_sizes=[], activations=[]): that creates the forward propagation graph for the neural network:

- x is the placeholder for the input data
- layer_sizes is a list containing the number of nodes in each layer of the network
- activations is a list containing the activation functions for each layer of the network
- Returns: the prediction of the network in tensor form
For this function, you should import your create_layer function with create_layer = __import__('1-create_layer').create_layer

## 3. Accuracy
Write the function def calculate_accuracy(y, y_pred): that calculates the accuracy of a prediction:

- y is a placeholder for the labels of the input data
- y_pred is a tensor containing the network’s predictions
- Returns: a tensor containing the decimal accuracy of the prediction
hint: accuracy = correct_predictions / all_predictions

## 4. Loss
Write the function def calculate_loss(y, y_pred): that calculates the softmax cross-entropy loss of a prediction:

- y is a placeholder for the labels of the input data
- y_pred is a tensor containing the network’s predictions
- Returns: a tensor containing the loss of the prediction

## 5. Train_Op
Write the function def create_train_op(loss, alpha): that creates the training operation for the network:

- loss is the loss of the network’s prediction
- alpha is the learning rate
- Returns: an operation that trains the network using gradient descent
